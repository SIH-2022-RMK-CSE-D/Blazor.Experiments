# Blazor.Experiments
This is the place where we learn and experiment with blazor.

## Current Progress
At the moment, we are doing the following works here
- Blazor components based on [Tabler](https://preview.tabler.io) styling
- Markdown Editor component based on [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) library

## Components
### `Blazor.Experiments.Components`
For now, I have added the mostly used controls in the list. We will be building the components in the `Blazor.Experiments.Components` project.
- [x] Navbar
- [ ] Button
- [ ] TextField
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Table
- [ ] Card
- [ ] Toast 
### `Blazor.Experiments.Markdown`
This (Razor Class Library) project is solely for creating required components for Markdown editing and previewing.

## How to Contribute
- To build the required components, we need a roadmap, or atleast a list of components in a table inside the Components section.
- To contribute to the code, please fork this repo into your own github, add your code in the fork and make a pull request into this repo, after which it will be integrated into this main repo.
